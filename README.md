# Random-Forest-vs-Boosted-Trees
The question answer format repository for Random Forest vs Boosted Trees.  

In this section, we shall compare the results of Random Forests (a Bagging
technique) with multiple Boosting Techniques over the tasks of classification
and regression specified above.
1. Train a Random Forest Classifier and Regressor along the same lines of
the Bagging exercise (for decision tree) and report the best-performing
hyper-parameters
2. Compare the results of the best Random Forest with the following Boosted
Decision Trees. Also, experiment with the number of estimators and plot
their training times and accuracies.
* Decision Trees + AdaBoost
* Gradient Boosted Decision Trees  
4. Provide an analysis of the mistakes of these models and try to explore and
explain the feature similarity of the common mistakes
